# Dopetox
A web app that helps people detox their dopamine levels; a dopamine detox app.

Dopamine detox, or dopamine fast, is a process where you detox all the things in your life that may overstimulate your brain and cause it to think that it needs more dopamine than it actually does; this overstimulation of your brain causes you to get easily distracted, since your brain is in constant need for instant pleasures and motivates you to take on those pleasures, thus making it hard to do the things in your life that are actually important because it seems "too boring."

**Dopetox** helps you detox your dopamine levels so that you can not only focus more on the things that may improve your life (the important things, even though it may take time and effort), but also for you to reset your dopamine levels to find pleasure in the "boring" or simple things in life.
